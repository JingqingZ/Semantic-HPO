### Some special cases needs attention

1. Past Medical History may not relate to the current admission

> as atenolol and digoxin hypertension hypercholesterolemia hypothyroidism recurrent urinary tract infections dyspnea on exertion hearing loss basal cell carcinomas osteopenia nosebleeds these are fairly new and have just started recently social history

12 (out of 24) phenotypic abnormalities are detected:

* Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis: `hypercholesterolemia`
* Abnormality of the skeletal system: `osteopenia`
* Neoplasm: `basal cell carcinomas`

2. Clinicians may not use exactly the same words to describe a phenotypic abnormalities

> as atenolol and digoxin hypertension hypercholesterolemia hypothyroidism recurrent urinary tract infections dyspnea on exertion hearing loss basal cell carcinomas osteopenia nosebleeds these are fairly new and have just started recently social history

* `dyspnea on exertion` (in text) vs. `exertional dyspnea` (HP:0002875)
* `nosebleeds` (in text) vs. `epistaxis` / `nosebleed` (HP:0000421)

> blood in your vomit you were initially treated in the icu with an insulin drip and your blood sugars improved

* `blood in you vomit` (in text) vs. `hematemesis` / `vomitting blood` (HP:0002248)
